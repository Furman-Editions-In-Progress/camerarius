# Furman University Â· CITE Tutorials

This repository hosts Jupyter notebooks illustrating usage of the [CITE Architecture](http://cite-architecture.org).

These notebooks use the [Almond kernel](https://almond.sh/).  You can run a notebook server with the Almond kernel using a docker container like this:

    docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 almondsh/almond:0.9.0

You can also work interactively with these notebooks on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Eumaeus/fuCite-jupyter/master).

If you have Jupyter Notebooks installed locally, with the Almond kernal, you can run this with:

    jupyter notebook

This work is based on that of [Neel Smith](https://github.com/neelsmith/nomisma-jupyter).
