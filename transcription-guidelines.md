# Transcription Guidelines

Useful tutorials and instructions are on the Youtube channel of Transkribus: https://www.youtube.com/@transkribus/videos.   

Note: for the markup of places, people, titles and quotations of Classical works, please refer to Matteo Romanello's Annotation Guidelines: https://zenodo.org/records/6368101

# Preliminary transcription guidelines

* Page numbers do not need to be transcribed.
* The Roman numeral entry numbers at the top of the page do not need to be transcribed.
* Any typos should be fixed in the transcription and do not need to be tagged.
* All Greek symbols should be fully resolved in the transcription and do not need to be tagged.
* There is no need to capitalize the second letter at the top of each page. Transcribe the word as it is.

  In this example, 'UT' should be transcribed as 'Ut'.

### Abbreviations and shorthand 

* All abbreviations and shorthand must be resolved using the Transkribus "abbr" tag. The fully expanded word should be typed inside the "expansion" field.

### Proper names 

* Names should be tagged using the "person" tag.
* There is no need to use the Person tag if it is in relation to a quotation or citation that has already been tagged. If the person does not have any reference tied to them in the text, then the Person tag may be used. 

### Citations and Quotations of other authors

A **Citation** is any reference to an outside author or work. For example, Aristotle lib. IV. cap. I.  
Citations will often contain abbreviated versions of authors names and work titles. These should be resolved as much as it is reasonable in the citation tag. Further research may reveal the correct way to resolve these citations.

**Quotations** will contain any direct quotes and should be tagged as Quotations. The Quotation tag has space for information about the author of the quote. Instead of using the Person tag for a reference, just use the Quotation tag.

See below in this document for researching quotations and citations (https://github.com/ChiaraPalladino/furesearch/blob/main/manuscript-transcription/README.md#tutorial-for-researching-quotationswords)

### Other 

* **Unclear elements** should be marked with the "unclear" tag. A question may be typed in the "question" attribute.
* **Words in a different language** than Latin need to be marked with the "language" tag on Transkribus and the language needs to be specified in the "language" attribute. This will often be Ancient Greek. You may also use the Wikidata identifier Q35497 (click on Wikidata ID and type "Ancient Greek" in the search window).

## Tutorial for researching quotations/words
First look up the author of the quotation in either library (scaife or philogic)
* Scaife: https://scaife.perseus.org/search/?q=neredum&kind=form&format=instances&p=1
* Philogic: https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/Greek/ 

Using Scaife, 
* Searching for the author will pull up their bibliography
* Sometimes the spelling doesn't match the citation
* Usually the longer the quotation the more accurate the spelling

Using Philogic,
* You have to search by the lemma
* It will pull up a bunch of options to choose from

Look up word in Logeion to see if Camerarius made a spelling error or if he's just using another form of the word
