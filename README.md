### About the project

Joachim Camerarius the Younger was a German botanist, zoologist, and humanist scholar. He first published the Symbola et Emblemata in 1590 but republished later updated editions in 1595, 1596, and 1604. His son Ludwig published a posthumous edition of this work adding aquatic animals and reptiles. The 1668 edition is divided into four "centuria", each focusing on a specific category. Centuria I is an entirely botanical piece, centuria II focuses on animals, centuria II on birds, reptiles and insects and centuria IV on aquatic animals and reptiles. The goal of this project is to use the Homer multitext image citation tool to identify and annotate Greek and Latin citations from classic works and to annotate the works and to translate the text in English. The final outcome will be to create a reader-friendly version of the text with annotations and a line-by-line translation of the text.

### Basic rules for transcription (in progress)

* End-of-line hyphens are not included.
* Page footers containing the first three letters of the following page are not included.
* Accents in Latin are always included in the transcription.
* Abbreviations and compendia are generally solved (e.g. & = "et").
* Text in Ancient Greek is in Betacode, e.g. 1.2.5: 
~~~
<gr>tw=|  w/dahzw=nh tou= lo/gou</gr>
~~~
* Text in another language than Latin is encoded in an XML-like notation, with the appropriate language code, e.g. 
for French,
~~~
<fr>...</fr>
~~~ 
for German, 
~~~
<de>...</de>
~~~
for Ancient Greek, 
~~~
<gr>...</gr>
~~~
* Special characters in Latin, e.g. strange accented letters, diphthongs, etc., are always transcribed with the corresponding Unicode character.
