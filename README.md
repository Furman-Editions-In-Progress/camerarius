## Welcome to the Digital Camerarius Project

The Digital Camerarius Project is an Undergraduate Research Project at Furman University. It started in 2019 with the goal of transcribing, annotating and identifying references to Classical Greek and Latin works in Joachim Camerarius' <i>Symbola et Emblemata</i>. The final deliverable of the project will include a reader-friendly version of the text with transcription, annotations and translation.

### About Camerarius

Joachim Camerarius the Younger was a German botanist, zoologist, and humanist scholar. He first published the Symbola et Emblemata in 1590 but republished later updated editions in 1595, 1596, and 1604. His son Ludwig published a posthumous edition of this work adding aquatic animals and reptiles. The 1668 edition is divided into four "centuria", each focusing on a specific category. Centuria I is an entirely botanical piece, centuria II focuses on animals, centuria III on birds, reptiles and insects and centuria IV on aquatic animals and reptiles.

## Methods and Technologies 

The project originally started as a part of the Homer Multitext Project, using the CITE Architecture and related technologies to transcribe the text (see further: https://www.homermultitext.org/). 

The individual pages of Camerarius can be seen through the HMT Image Transcription Tool: 
- [Praefatio (and Covers)](praef_thumbs.md)
- [Volume 1](vol1_thumbs.md)
- [Volume 2](vol2_thumbs.md)
- [Volume 3](vol3_thumbs.md)
- [Volume 4](vol4_thumbs.md)

As of 2024, the project has transitioned on Transkribus (transkribus.org). For an overview of our transcription tags and guidelines, see the Guidelines in this repository.
